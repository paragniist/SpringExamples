How to create our own custom auto-configuration classes?
while developing applications we dont need to create our own custom auto-configurations. When we are working on product development or libraries, we distribute to the world, so that people reuse our libraries in building their solutions

In such case if others has to use our library or product, they have to do 2 things:
1. inorder to use our library or product they need to know which 3rd party dependencies our product requires to use it
2. if there are building their application using spring framework/spring boot, they need to take care of configuring the our product/library classes as bean definitions with in their application

look like integrating our product/library into their solutions is an time-taking job since they need to identify the transitive dependencies and has to configure our library components in their application which takes lot of time and complexity.
	
Instead to make our library/product to be easily integretable into their solution while developing using spring boot we can distribute our library with starter/autoconfigurations by ourself.
	
Now people around the world, to use our library in building the solutions they can quickly import starter dependency and auto-configurations through which the 3rd party libraries are resolved easily and inaddition our product components are configured as bean definitions by auto-configurations through which they can build their application quickly 

In that case only we need to build our own auto-configuration classes to integrate our libraries / products with the world
