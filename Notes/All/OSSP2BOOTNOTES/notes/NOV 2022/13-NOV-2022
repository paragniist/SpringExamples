What are the advantages of using embedded servlet containers?
1. the containers are shipped aspart of the code, so no need to download, install/configure to use them
2. In an traditional application deployment, after install the container, the deployer has to perform necessary configurations on the container manually like
- connection pool configuration
- jms queues/topics
- security configurations
There are problems in manually configuring them
1. human errors
2. lot of time
3. should be applied repeatedly across the env 

while working with embedded containers, the server and project specific configurations are applied through the code itself due to which we can avoid manualy configurations on the server env

3. easy to adopt in CI/CD
The continous integration and delivery tools like
1. jenkins
2. hudson
3. bamboo
4. concourse
5. teamcity
etc
using the ci/cd tools we create 3 piplelines for facilitating the release of the application
ci (continous integration) pipeline
cd (continous deployment) pipeline
cd (continous delivery) pipeline
