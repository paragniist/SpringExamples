event-driven programming
event-driven programming is a programming technic or a programming paradigm in which the flow of execution of the program is determined based on the events being exchanged between the programs of the application
There are several reasons for using event driven programming model
1. by adopting an event-driven programming model, the components of our application will become completely loosely coupled, without knowing the interfaces of each other the components can exchange events and communicate with each other
2. through event-driven programming model we achieve asynchronous communication between the programs of our application
3. even-driven programming only allow one-way communication between the programs
