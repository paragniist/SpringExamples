How to setup an spring boot project by using gradle build tool?
Gradle is an another build tool which is evolved as an alternate to the maven for building java projects. There are few short-falls with maven to overcome them the gradle has been introduced
1. maven strictly enforces standards in building an project, for eg.. we need to follow standardized directory structure in creating and building an java project 
2. plugins are the only way through which we can accomplish a build step or build activity, customizing the build process is a difficult job

To overcome the above problems gradle tool has been introduced.
1. it is recommended to create a project using standardized directory layout, but it is optional and if our requirement are diverging from defaults we can customize them unlike maven.
2. different projects requires different build activities to be applied, so the concept of maven build lifecycle doesnt apply any more. so gradle has introduced plugins
Plugins enforces 2 things
1. standardized directory structure
2. tasks to be applied on the project to build are defined

Now based on the type of the project we are working on choose and apply an appropriate plugin
		
similar to ANT, in gradle we need to build.gradle which is an build script file in which we define
1. plugins
2. dependencies
3. repositories
4. we can write tasks to applying additional build activities apart from default
