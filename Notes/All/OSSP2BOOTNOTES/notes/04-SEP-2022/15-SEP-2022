#2. creating an spring boot project from spring-boot-starter-parent
spring boot developers has created lot of starter dependencies each per the technologies we use in project/application development. The starter dependencies are nothing but empty maven artifacts attached with pom.xml
within the pom.xml they have declared spring modules, dependent spring modules and third-party libraries along with their compatible versions as transitive dependencies specific to technology towards the starter is created.
Now developers can quickly create the project by adding spring boot starter dependencies of the relevant technology.	
	
For each spring framework version, a new spring boot version is released, provided with starter dependencies pertaining to the corresponding spring release.
unfortunately the spring boot version and spring framework version are different, because spring boot has been introduced at a later stages of spring framework 3
	
How to migrate from older version of spring framework to newer version of spring framework while working with spring boot?
we need to update the boot starter dependencies to the latest release of spring boot version corresponding to the spring framework release version along with plugins
It takes lot of time to migrate to an newer version of spring boot version (spring framework version), so to overcome the problem spring boot team has provided spring-boot-starter-parent project


spring-boot-starter-parent 
|-pom.xml 
  groupId=org.springframework.boot
	artifactId=spring-boot-starter-parent
	version=2.7.3
	packaging=pom
-----------------------------------------	
  dependencyManagement
	|-dependencies
		[all spring boot starter dependencies with version]
	pluginManagement
	|-plugins
		[configured spring-boot-maven-plugin with version & configuration]


bootmaven
|-src
	|-main
		|-java
		|-resources
|-pom.xml
	|-parent
		|-groupId=org.springframework.boot
		|-artifactId=spring-boot-starter-parent
		|-version=2.7.3
	|-groupId
	|-artifactId
	|-version
	|-dependencies
		|-declare spring boot starter dependencies we want to use without versions
	|-plugins
		|-declare spring-boot-maven-plugin without configuration & versions
