How does SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args) begins execution of the application?
To run an spring framework based application we need to host all our application classes as bean definitions within the ioc container and load all the configurations into Environment object of the ioc container, so that these values can be injected as primitive dependencies within our bean definitions

All these activities of bringing up the application while working with spring framework are taken care by SpringApplication. So the run() method takes care of handling all the responsibilities in bringing up an Spring Framework application
There are several activities being performed by SpringApplication.run(..) method as below
1. creates an empty environment object
2. detects and loads the external configuration of our application into the environment object created above
3. prints the spring boot banner
4. detects or identify the type of the application based on the dependencies we added under the classpath and instantiate appropriate ioc container
	if Spring WebMvc dependencies are found under the classpath, treat the WebApplicationType=WEB
		instantiates AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext 
	else if Spring WebFlux dependencies are found under the classpath, treats the WebApplicationType=REACTIVE
		instantiates AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext
	else treats the WebApplicationType = NONE
		instantiates AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
5. instantiates and registers spring factories (autoconfiguration)
6. invokes ApplicationContextInitializers 
7. prepareContext() = loads all the bean definitions 
8. refreshContext() = instantiate the objects of the bean definitions
9. invokes the CommandLineRunners & ApplicationRunners
upon successful execution of CommandLineRunners & ApplicationRunners, the reference of ioc container will be  returned to us
10.during the above stages of bringing up the spring boot application, the SpringApplication publishes events and triggers the listeners in performing additional activities

4. identity type of application based on which create an ioc container
	if webmvc dependencies are found, treat WebApplicationType=WEB
		AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext
	if webflux dependencies are found, treat WebApplicationType=REACTIVE
		AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext
	else WebApplicationType=NONE
		AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
5. instantiates and registers spring factories
6. invokes ApplicationContextInitializers
7. prepareContext()
8. refreshContext()
9. invokes command-line runners and ApplicationRunners
10 publish events and triggers listeners
