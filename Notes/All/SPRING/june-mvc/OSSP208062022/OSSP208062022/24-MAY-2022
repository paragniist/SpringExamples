Spring Web Mvc Module
----------------------
We can develop web applications in java language using Servlet/Jsp api, then why do we need Spring Mvc Module for building web application?
	
The Servlet/Jsp are api provided by Sun Microsystems to build web applications in java language, The apis will not provide boiler-plate logic in developing application. While building Web Application using Servlet/Jsp the boiler-plate logic has to be written by the developer

While developing an web application there are 2 most common requirements we need to build in the application.
	1. request wrapping
	2. form handling
