What are the advantages of using annotations?
1. annotations are short in nature and spans at max 1 word and easy to memorize and write it as part of source code of the java class
2. annotations are also java types only we dont need to learn something other than java to work with annotations
3. since we write annotations directly as part of source code during the time compilation the compiler will validate and displays any mis-configuration issues which saves lot of roundtrips in validating the configuration while working with xml
