How to register programmatically the web application components without web.xml?
We need to register all of the components information into the ServletContext of the application.
	
There are 2 ways to do this
#1 ServletContextListener
In our application we can write ServletContextListener, and annotate it using @Listener. In this class we can write the code for programmatically registering a Webapplication components of our application into ServletContext

#2. Framework or third-party libraries
The above approach of programmatically registering the components through ServletContext listener will not work, because
The Framework vendors may provide implementations of ServletContextListener pre-written with the logic of registering the Framework components and annotate the class with @Listener and ship them as part of jar modules
The application developers imports these Framework Jar modules and use them in building their application. during the time of building the application, the application developer might mark the metadata-complete="true" in the web.xml, due to which the metadata scanning of the jar modules will not takes place and the framework components will not be bootstrapped or registered.
	
To overcome the above problem, the servlet specification has provided an new api from Jee5 onwards in bootstrapping the framework or third-party vendors about their components programmatically

Write a implementation class implementing from ServletContainerInitializer interface
	
interface ServletContainerInitializer {
	void onStartup(ServletContext context, Set<Class<?>> classes);
}
