For rendering an excel as a view, spring webmvc has integrated with apache poi api. apache poi is a library that helps us in reading/writing an excel documents.

apache poi has provided api classes to work with reading/writing the excel documents. An excel document is represented by WorkBook
Inside the WorkBook we can create Sheet. 
In each Sheet we can add row and create cell inside the row for storing the data
	
instead of we writing an view class by implementing from View interface and write apache poi logic in creating an excel view
Spring Mvc has provided an abstract view class for creating excel documents quickly called AbstractExcelView 

abstract class AbstractExcelView implements View {
	public void render(httpReq, httpResp, Map<String, Object> modelMap) {
		// the logic for creating WorkSheet
		buildExcelDocument(modelMap, workSheet, httpReq, httpResp);
	}
	abstract void buildExcelDocument(Map<String, Object> modelMap, WorkSheet sheet, httReq, httpResp);
}
	
class StatementExcelView extends AbstractXlsView {
	void buildExcelDocument(Map<String, Object> modelMap, WorkBook workBook, 
													httReq, httpResp) {
		
		
	}
}
