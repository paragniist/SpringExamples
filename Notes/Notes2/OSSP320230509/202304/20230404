class Calculator {
	int i;
	int j;
	
	public Calculator() {
		i = 10;
		j = 20;
	}
	
	int add() {
		sum = i + j;
		return sum;
	}
}

Calculator cal = new Calculator();
cal.init();

1. we are requesting the jvm to create the object
2. jvm is creating the object

we want to perform post construction logic after the object has been born


// no we need to perform initialization or post construction activity ontop of the object
cal.init();

cal.add();


Calculator cal1 = new Calculator();
cal1.init();
cal1.add();
